### Number Guesser
Module 1 project | Turing School of Software & Design

---

#### Summary
This assignment was my first project in the Front-End Engineering Program at Turing. Number Guesser generates a random number between 1 and 100. The user's objective is to guess the number by using feedback from previous guesses (e.g. "too high" or "too low"). Every time the user guesses correctly, the minimum range is decreased by 10 and the maximum range is increased by the same number. The user can also increase or decrease the difficulty of the game by setting a custom range.

#### Learning Goals
  * Develop skills in writing:
    * semantic HTML
    * clean & organized CSS styles
    * DRY and organized JavaScript
  * Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
  * Understand event bubbling and use event delegation on dynamic elements

#### Personal Challenges
Being the first time I'd written JavaScript, I found it challenging to understand the idea of scope and hoisting. My knowledge of these concepts was solidified over time with practice and further research. I also had a hard time understanding how to manipulate the DOM, but figured out how to research methods and properties over the course of this project.
